    "Similar to BFS, depth-first search (DFS) is another important algorithm to traverse/search in a tree/graph. And also it can be used in more abstract scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in tree traversal, we can use DFS to do pre-order, in-order and post-order traversal. There is a common feature among these three traversal orders: we never trace back unless we reach the deepest node.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is also the largest difference between DFS and BFS, BFS never go deeper unless it has already visited all nodes at the current level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, we implement DFS using recursion. Stack plays an important role in recursion. We will explain the role of the stack when doing recursion in this chapter. We will also show you what's the drawback of recursion and provide another implementation of DFS without recursion.\n",
    "\n",
    "DFS is an important topic when preparing for the interview. The actual design of DFS varies from problem to problem. This chapter focuses on how stack is applied in DFS and helps you to understand the principle of DFS better. To be a master of DFS algorithm, you still need lots of practice."
