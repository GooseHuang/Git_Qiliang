    "MergeSort is a *divide and conquer* algorithm that divides a list into equal halves until it has two single elements and then merges the sub-lists until the entire list has been reassembled in order.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Divide\n",
    "Our MergeSort code will focus first on the divide portion of the algorithm. If the list we receive has only a single element in it, the list can be considered sorted and we can return immediately.  This is our recursion base case.  If we have more than 1 element we need to split the list into equal halves and call MergeSort again for each half.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conquer\n",
    "Once you have split the list down to single elements, your mergesort will start merging lists, in order, until you have reassembled the entire list in order.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Design\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's sketch this out. It's clear we want a recursive function, but how will it govern its recursion?\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def mergesort(items):\n",
    "    # Base case, a list of 0 or 1 items is already sorted\n",
    "    if len(items) <= 1:\n",
    "        return items\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Otherwise, find the midpoint and split the list\n",
    "    # TODO\n",
    "    # left =\n",
    "    # right =\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Call mergesort recursively with the left and right half\n",
    "    left = mergesort(left)\n",
    "    right = mergesort(right)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Merge our two halves and return\n",
    "    return merge(left, right)\n",
    "    \n",
    "def merge(left, right):\n",
    "    # Given two ordered lists, merge them together in order,\n",
    "    # returning the merged list.\n",
    "    # TODO\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We have decomposed the problem, now we will address each piece separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Divide\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use python's `//` operator to find a midpoint. If `items`'s length is even, we will have the midpoint. If `items`'s length is odd, we will have one half larger by one."
