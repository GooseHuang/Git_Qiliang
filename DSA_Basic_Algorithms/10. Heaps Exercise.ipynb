    "\n",
    "A doctor is working in an emergency wing at a hospital. When patients come in, a nurse checks their symptoms and based on the severity of the illness, sends them to the doctor. For e.g. a guy who has had an accident is sent before someone who has come with a runny nose. But there is a slight problem. There is only one nurse and only one doctor. In the amount of time nurse takes to check the symptoms, the doctor has to work alone with the patients, hurting their overall productivity. \n",

    "You are a ninja programmer. The doctor comes to you for help. Your job is to write a small software in which patients will enter their symptoms and will receive a priority number based on their illness. The doctor has given you a list of common ailments, and the priority in which he would prefer seeing them. How would you solve the priority problem?"

    "However, not all implementations are ideal. When we implemented a regular queue earlier, you may remember the `enqueue` and `dequeue` methods had a time complexity of $O(1)$. Similarly, we would like the `insert` and `remove` methods on our priority queue to be fast.\n",

    "4. We have looked at what CBT is and what Heap Order Property is\n",
    "\n",
    "By now, it must have been clear to you that we are going to use Heaps to create our Priority Queues. But are you convinced that heaps are a good structure to create Priority Queues?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Other than Binary Search trees, all other popular data structures seemed to have a time complexity of `O(n)` for both `insertion and removal`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Binary Search Trees seemed like an effective data structure with average case time complexity of `O(log(n)` (or `O(h)`) for both the operations.  However, in the worst case, a Binary Search Tree may not be balanced and instead behave like a linked list. In such a case, the time complexity in terms of height would still be `O(h)` but because the height of the binary search tree will be equal to the number of elements in the tree, the actual time complexity in terms of `number of elements n` would be `O(n)`.\n",

    "3. The CBT property of Heaps ensures that the tree is always balanced. Therefore, the `height h` of the tree will always be equal to `log(n)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The Heap Order Property ensures that there is some definite structure to our Complete Binary Tree with respect to the value of the elements. In case of a min-heap, the minimum element will always lie at the root node. Similarly, in case of a maxp-heap, the maximum element will always lie at the root node. In both the cases, every time we `insert or remove` an element, the time complexity remains `O(log(n))`. \n",
